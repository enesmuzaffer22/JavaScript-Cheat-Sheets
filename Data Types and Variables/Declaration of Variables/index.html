    <!--Generally, we using "var" and "let" for declare a variable. For example:
    
    var x = 5;
    let name = "James";

    But these two keywords are now same. There are a few diffrences between of them. Let's explain:

    You can use "var" keyword everywhere on your codes. But you can't use this situation for "let" keyword. Because "let" is block keyword.
    You can use "let" keyword for one block, you can't use at outside of the block. Also, "let" keyword is a new keyword (since 2015). So,
    if you want to support your code for old browsers, you should use "var" keyword.
    
    Another diffrence is, you can't declare a same variable more than one with "let" keyword.

    And one more diffrence, you can't use any variable before declare with "let" keyword. But you can with "var" keyword. Let's see with
    an example:
    
    -->

    <script>
        var a = 1;
        document.write(a + " ");

        let b = 2;
        document.write(b + " ");

        document.write(c + " "); //write "var c" before definition will return "undefined".
        var c = 3;

        document.write(d + " "); //giving error
        let d = 4;
    </script>
</body>
